**Guides** will include:

- Two walkthrough, project-based tutorials
- "Foundations" guides: prerequisite web development topics that aren't part of Solid itself, but necessary to understand Solid
- How-to guides: task-specific walkthroughs. (e.g. "How to set up Solid with Vite", "Choosing a styling solution")
