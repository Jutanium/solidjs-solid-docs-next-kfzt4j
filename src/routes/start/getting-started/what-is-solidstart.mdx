<Title>What is SolidStart?</Title>

Web applications are often comprised of many components: databases, servers, front-ends, bundlers, data fetching/mutations, caching, and infrastructure. Orchestrating these components is challenging and often requires a large amount of shared state and redundant logic across the application stack.

Enter SolidStart: a framework that provides many of these components out-of-the-box and integrates them seamlessly!

SolidStart is considered a _meta-framework_ (a framework built on top of another framework) because, at it's core, SolidStart is powered by [SolidJS](https://solidjs.com) and the Solid router.

SolidStart enables you to render your application in different ways depending on what's best for your use case:

- Client-side rendering (CSR)
- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Streaming SSR
- Static site generation (SSG)

If you're not familiar with these, that's ok! As we progress through these docs, we'll talk a bit about different ways to render your applications and help you choose the best fit.

One of the driving principles of SolidStart is that code should be _isomorphic_&mdash;you should be able to write code once and it will run correctly regardless of whether it's being run on the client or server. As we move through the docs, we'll discover just how powerful isomorphism is!

## Features

SolidStart touts the following feature set:

- **Fine-grained reactivity.** Since SolidStart is a SolidJS meta-framework, it benefits from the find-grained reactivity offered by SolidJS.
- **Isomorphic, nested routing.** You write the same routes regardless of whether the page is rendered on the client or server. Route nesting provides parent-child relationships that simplify application logic.
- **Multiple rendering modes.** SolidStart can be used to create CSR, SSR, streaming SSR, or SSG applications.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI) and templates.** Get up and running quickly with starters.
- **Deployment adapters.** SolidStart provides adapters to support deployment to your favorite platfrom&mdash;Netlify, Vercel, and Cloudflare, to name a few.

## Prerequisites

We recommend that you know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before digging in to SolidStart. Since SolidStart is a SolidJS meta-framework, we also recommend you know SolidJS prior to digging in to these docs (or at least [take the SolidJS tutoral](https://www.solidjs.com/tutorial)).

## SolidStart is in Beta!

We're very excited that you're checking out the SolidStart Beta release! Since SolidStart is in beta, you may find some bugs as you explore the framework. We would appreciate if you report these bugs to us using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start/issues).
