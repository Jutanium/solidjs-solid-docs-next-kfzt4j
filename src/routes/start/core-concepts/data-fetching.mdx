# Data fetching

- Why we need to use `routeData`: Render-as-you-fetch pattern, start fetching data as your component is rendering

- Short `createResource` recap

- Fetching data from your backend (using `server` function) (`server` is becoming a low-level API that might not commonly be used)

  - how this works on server vs. client
  - Usage with routeData
  - using `Suspense` (how this works normally vs. streaming)

- Top level Suspense required for async rendering to fetch things on the server

- ErrorBoundary catching errors from resources (important part is where you access the resource not where its declared)

Potential New APIs

- `createRouteResource` (new API)

  - to be used in routeData function (not other places coz it'll cause waterfall which is bad)
  - When data mutations are run, we need to invaldiate the resources and fetch fresh results
  - When user navigates to an old route, we need to refetch resources
  - When resource fetcher throws/returns a Redirect, then tell the router to handle it

- `createServerResource` might subsume `server`

  - if you want the data to be fetched and processed on the server always
  - if you want to use your database in a safe way, do it on the server inside `createServerResource`
  - `createRouteResource(server(fn))`

- if you want data from a SolidStart API route in your component, use `server.fetch('/api/hello')`
- if you want data from an external API in your component, use same old `fetch('/api/hello')`
