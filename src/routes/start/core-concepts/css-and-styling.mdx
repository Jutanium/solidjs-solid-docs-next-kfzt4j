<Title>CSS and Syling</Title>

- Talk about vite and using CSS by importing it, can use tailwind etc

- SSR CSS and using some CSS-in-js solution that requires you to render the stylesheet separately and add it to the HTML before sending it to client
  - try to use https://github.com/solidjs/solid-styled-components as an example
