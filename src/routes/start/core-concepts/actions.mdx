<Title>Actions</Title>

- `createAction`

  - isomorphic
  - Gives a way to submit an action and track the submission. Similar to a form on the web.
  - Represents the `POST` side of HTTP verbs
  - retriggers route resources
  - what does it give you:
    - an async function (`action.submit(args)`, `action(args)`) to trigger the action
    - `action.submissions()` a signal to track the ongoing and failed submissiions
    - `action.Form` to render a Form component that calls this action as its submit handler (Progressively enhanced forms)
      - caveat: `action.Form` will only be available when your action signature matches `(formData: FormData) => Response`
  - Errors, each submission state has an error field thats populated if the submission errored, and a status field that's set to `error`
    - if you read the `submissionState.error` field in your code (JSX, or effects) then the error is considered user-handled and we don't trigger ErrorBoundaries.
    - if you don't use the error field, then we trigger the error boundary on an error because we assume its unexpected for you

```tsx
action.submitWithKey(args, key);

action.submissions() = {
  submission1: {
    error: null | Error,
  },
  submission2: {},
};
```

- `createServerAction`
  - `createAction(server(fn))`
  - if you want to run your action on the server only and access your database
